# Week 3 Report

## Overview:

Everyone was doing the best they could, the whole team put a lot of time and effort and we managed to get a working demo at the end.

We showed a frontend from which you were able to send transactions from a specific peer ot another specific peer. You are able to select the amount and each transaction can be seen in the transactions history panel. As well as that, we showed our work in progress of our uniswap (from one currency to another) feature again per specific peer.

We are all proud with the result and learned a lot in the course, thank you Bulat!
